# VSD--TCL--WORKSHOP : From Introduction to Advanced Scripting Techniques in Design and Synthesis
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Introduction
Tool Command Language (Tcl) is a scripting language commonly used in across domains because of its flexibility and ease of integration with other programming languages and tools.

## DAY-1

Introduction to TCL and VSDSYNTH Tool box
letting the system know that its a UNIX script

```
#!/bin/tcsh -f  
```

verifying three general scenarios for a user POV and giving info w.r.t case by the script below
  - user doesnt enter the csv file
  - user enters the wrong csv file/ file doesnt exist
  - user enters __-help__

source the Unix shell to the Tcl script by passing the required csv file as an argument

```
tclsh vsdsynth.tcl $argv[1]
```
Note : Make sure the file is executable by using the command ``` chmod -R 777 ``` 

## DAY-2
__Converting inputs to format[1] and feeding it to yosys for synthesis__

  ###Create Variables

  __- Checking if the directories exist or not ( done to prevent the script from breaking )__

Displays an error when the required file is not in the needed directory

## DAY-3

__Read Constraints.csv file and convert to sdc format__

  - getting clock details from csv file and writing it the sdc file in the required format
  - getting input details from csv file and writing it in the required format
  - getting output details from csv file and writing it in the required format
 
Note: need to identify bussed and non bussed inputs and outputs before entering in the required format.

The script writing the sdc constraints.

## DAY-4

### YOSYS (Yosys Open SYnthesis Suite)

YOSYS is an open-source RTL synthesis and formal verification framework for digital circuits. It takes RTL descriptions (e.g., Verilog) as input and performs synthesis to generate a gate-level netlist. YOSYS supports technology mapping, optimization, and formal verification. It has a scripting interface, integrates with other EDA tools, and is widely used in academia and industry for digital design tasks.

__Creating scripts for synthesis and running it on yosys__

  - creating script for Hierarchy check and running it on different cases:

  Case --> When all the modules are present and called by verilog file

  Case --> moduled referenced and not called or module doesn't exist and calling by verilog

  - after the hierarchy check is passed . The main synthesis script is written.
  - running synthesis if there is no error in hierarchy check.

  Case -->  All hierarchies present in design

  Case --> error encountered in hierarchy
